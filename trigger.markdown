As an explicit exception to most scenarios - don't assume no cheating this time.


This one is aimed at L2s but I'm posting it here so others can learn from it too. So, if you're not L2 please wait until after your FNM before you jump in with answers.


At a Legacy competitive REL event -  
Sidisi calls you over to her match and asks to speak with you away from the table. You step aside and she says   
"We just finished game three and my opponent Tibalt said   
'Hey, you know you missed the life gain from your Deathrite Shaman back in game two right? You'd have won if you'd remembered that'.  
He totally cheated me!".


What do you do?


[To Tibalt (seperately to Sididi):   
"Could you run me through how Game 2 went?"  
Likely follow up question of: 
"Did Sidisi miss some life gain?"  
&: "When did you realise that?"][1]

[I would start by asking "There was a situation where apparently Sidisi forgot to gain life? Could you walk me through what happened in that game?".  
I would be watching for words like "lifegain trigger" and other signs that the player just does not understand how resolving an ability works.][2]
